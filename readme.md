## Developing

This project uses shadow-cljs as a build tool. It has pretty good [user documentation](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html), I'd recommend following the start up guide to get a feel for what it does.

It is highly recommended to install clojure support on your code editor. The shadow-cljs user guide has a section on doing this for many common editors.

This project uses reagent, a thin cljs wrapper around react. It's well worth reading the [introduction](https://reagent-project.github.io/), and the [api documentation](https://cljdoc.org/d/reagent/reagent/0.10.0/doc/documentation-index).
